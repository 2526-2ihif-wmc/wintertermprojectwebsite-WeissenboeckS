<h1>League of Legends</h1>
<div id="text">
<p><b>“Once, in the vast and fragile world of Runeterra, before kingdoms had names and before mortals dared to grasp the
    power of the heavens…”</b></p>
<p>There were forces older than memory—titans of creation, spirits of wild magic, and cosmic beings who shaped reality
    as easily as mortals shape clay. Their power seeped into the land, into the oceans, into the hearts of living creatures.
    And so, Runeterra was born: a world where magic was not a myth, but a force that breathed and roared. <br> Ages passed,
    and civilizations began to rise. Some were guided by wisdom; others were driven by hunger for power. <br><br> From the icy,
    war-torn lands of Freljord, where ancient gods slumber beneath frozen mountains…<br>
    To the golden empire of Shurima, once ruled by Ascended demigods who shone like living suns… <br>
    To the shadowed realm of Ionia, where the spirit world bleeds into reality like ink into water… <br> <br>Across all these
    lands, stories unfolded—stories of heroes and tyrants, of kingdoms built on hope or shattered by ambition. <br> But peace was
    never destined to last. <br> <br>The discovery of arcane power, the rise of forbidden technologies, and the opening of doors to realms
    beyond mortal understanding invited chaos. Great empires collapsed. Old gods awakened. New forces—mysterious, beautiful,
    and terrifying—entered the world.<br> <br>And in the midst of this turmoil stood the Champions: <br>Warriors, mages,
    assassins, prophets, monsters, and rulers—each forged by their own past, each driven by dreams or demons. Some fought
    to protect Runeterra. Others sought to conquer it. Others still wished only to survive.<br><br><b>Their fates entwined,
        their stories collided, and their battles echoed across continents.</b> <br>For whether they fought for glory, vengeance,
            duty, freedom, or chaos…<br>Every clash, every choice, every spark of magic helped shape the destiny of Runeterra.<br>
            And so the tale continues—ever expanding, ever changing—<br><b>a world where legends are born in the heat of battle,<br>
                and every champion leaves a mark on the soul of Runeterra.<br></b></p>
